It uses new Computing the Coin’s Probability (See EPEW++ Document). The algortim says that if p1*<=p2* choose 
p as (Theta/n * 1/lamada) - 0.001. If p1*>p2* choose p as repeating p=p1-delta until p is found. However,
recenlty, we change algorithm by ignroing optimal probabilies and use {0.05,0.1,0.15,0.2,...,1.0} see pcakabge SyncV2.
